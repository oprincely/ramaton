Matthew Oliver Goodwin: NUMEROLOGY; The Complete Guide API

category: spirituality/numerology

small_description:
Once upon a time, I met Matthew Oliver Goodwin, Through his NUMEROLOGY: The Complete Guide BOOK, he said:

 "Numerology is the study of the occult significance of numbers. It's probably the simplest of the occult fields to learn and master. Using numerology, you can discover a person's strengths and weaknesses, deep inner needs, emotional reactions, ways of dealing with others, talents."

Then I have translated his theory and practical to an API, a software that calculates the numbers. I wrote it in Python language.

Usage: one need to supply the

 data = {firstname:'Emeka', middlename:'Uchechukwu', lastname:'Okwuego',date_of_birth:'22/02/1984'}

API response: 

data = {
"lifePath": 26,
"birthday": 22,
"expression": 22,
"SoulUrge": 25,
"effectiveness_of_lifepath_expression_1": 4,
"effectiveness_of_lifepath_soulUrge_3": 1,
"effectiveness_of_exp_soulUrge_5": 3,
"secret_self": 15,
