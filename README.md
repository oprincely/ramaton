# Ramaton - Matthew Oliver Goodwin | NUMEROLOGY | The Complete Guide API (Automation with python)

###### category: Occultism/numerology

###### small description:
Once upon a time, I met **Matthew Oliver Goodwin**, Through his _NUMEROLOGY: The Complete Guide_ BOOK, where he said:

>Numerology is the study of the occult significance of numbers. It's probably the simplest of the occult fields to learn and master. Using numerology, you can discover a person's strengths and weaknesses, deep inner needs, emotional reactions, ways of dealing with others, talents.

Then I have translated his theory and practice to an API, a software that calculates the numbers. I wrote it in **Python Programming language**. As a [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). I have to render it as a web page and **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JAVASCRIPT** help out.

**Usage:** one need to supply the
```
data = {
    "firstname": "Emeka",
    "middlename": "Uchechukwu",
    "lastname": "Okwuego",
    "date_of_birth": "22/02/1984"
}
```
API response: 

```
data = {
  "lifePath": 10,
  "lp_sub_element": [2,4,4],
  "birthday": 22,
  "effectiveness_of_lifepath_exp": 10,
  "expression": 22,
  "exp_sub_element": [8,7,7],
  "effectiveness_of_lifepath_soulUrge": 8,
  "SoulUrge": 18,
  "sU_sub_element": [11,5,2],
  "effectiveness_of_exp_soulUrge": 2,
  "secret_self": 13,
  "maturity_number": 23,
  "growth_number": 25,
  "prime_intensifier": 5,
  "challenge": 2,
  "physical": "Strong",
  "mental": "Average",
  "emotional": "Weak",
  "intuitive": "Strong",
  "first_letter": "E",
  "first_vowel": "E",
  "number_counts": {"n1": 1,"n2": 3,"n3": 6,"n4": 1,"n5": 6,"n6": 2,"n7": 1,"n8": 2,"n9": 0}
}
```
